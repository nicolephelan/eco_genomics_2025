# Below here, give you bash script with your list of commands


# This script loops through a set of files defined by MYSAMP, matching left and right reads
# and cleans the raw data using fastp according to parameters set below

# Next, let's load our required modules:
module purge
module load gcc fastp

# Define the path to the transcriptomics folder in your Github repo.
MYREPO="/users/n/m/nmphelan/projects/eco_genomics_2025/"

# make a new directory within myresults/ to hold the fastp QC reports
mkdir ${MYREPO}/transcriptomics/myresults/fastp_reports

# cd to the location (path) to the fastq data:

cd /gpfs1/cl/ecogen/pbio6800/Transcriptomics/RawData

# Define the sample code to anlayze
# Be sure to replace with your 2-digit sample code

MYSAMP="C2"

# for each file that has "MYSAMP" and "_1.fq.gz" (read 1) in the name
# the wildcard here * allows for the different reps to be captured in the list
# start a loop with this file as the input:

for READ1 in ${MYSAMP}*_R1*.gz
do

# the partner to this file (read 2) can be found by replacing the _1.fq.gz with _2.fq.gz
# second part of the input for PE reads

READ2=${READ1/_R1*.gz/_R2*.gz}

# make the output file names: print the fastq name, replace _# with _#_clean
