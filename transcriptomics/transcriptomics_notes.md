# Transcriptomics Module Notes

## Fall 2025 Ecological Genomics

## Author: Nicole Phelan

This is a place for me to keep my notes on my electronic/server activities during the transcriptomics module.

### 10/7/2025 Getting started with the module

-   On the first day of transcriptomics, I learned about the motivation and process of asking questions and analyzing RNA sequence data.

-   I started to run fastp to clean and visualize the data quality in my fastq files, but I ran into file recognition issues.

    -   To be continued on Thursday...

### 10/9/2025 Running fastp

-   I copied the fastp_tonsa.sh script from the `gpfs1/cl/ecogen/pbio6800/Transcriptomics/scripts` folder to `~/projects/eco_genomics_2025/transcriptomics/myscripts`.

    -   I edited the file to set my population to C2 and set my directory to my repository.

-   I copied the salmon_quant.sh script to `myscripts` similarly and I ran it in sbatch.
