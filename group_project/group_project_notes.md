### 11/11/2025 Extracting the Climate Data for the Exome Capture Samples

-   In order to execute the function install.packages("geodata"), the Rstudio session needed to be run using Rgeospatial/4.5.1.
-   An R script was created called RDA_Analysis.R in `~projects/eco_genomics_2025/group_project/myscripts`.
-   Using the 'geodata' package in R, a dataframe was generated for each of the exome-capture red spruce population coordinates, elevations, and WorldClim data
