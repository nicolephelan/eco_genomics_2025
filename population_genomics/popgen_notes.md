This will keep my notes on population genomics coding sessions.

### 09/11/2025: Cleaning fastq reads of red spruce

-   I wrote a bash script called fastp.sh located within my GitHub repo:

`/~/projects/eco_genomics_2025/population_genomics/myscripts`

-   I used this script to trim out the adapters of the red spruce fastq sequence file.

-   The raw fastq files are located on the class share space:

`/gpfs1/cl/ecogen/pbio6800/PopulationGenomics/fastq/red_spruce`

-   Using the program fastp, I processed the raw reads and output the cleaned reads to the following directory on the class shared space:

`/gpfs1/cl/ecogen/pbio6800/PopulationGenomics/cleanreads`

-   Fastp produced reports for each sample, which I saved into the directory:

`/~/projects/eco_genomics_2025/population_genomics/myresults/fastp_reports`

-   The results showed high quality sequence with most Q-scores being \>\>20, and low amount of adapter contamination, which we trimmed out. We also trimmed out the leading 12 base pairs to get rid of the bar-code indices.

-   Cleaned reads are now ready to proceed to the next step in our pipeline: mapping to the reference genome.

### 09/16/2025: Mapping cleaned red spruce reads to the reference genome

-   I copied the bash scripts (bam_stats.sh, mapping.sh, and process_bam.sh) and text file (SBATCH_header.txt) from

`/gpfs1/cl/ecogen/pbio6800/PopulationGenomics/scripts`

to

`/~/projects/eco_genomics_2025/population_genomics/myscripts`

-   I mapped my clean reads to the black spruce reference genome using bwa-mem2.

-   After mapping, I processed the sequence alignment (.sam)

    -   The outputs are saved in `population_genomics/myresults/`

### 09/18/2025: Review bamstats and set up nucleotide diversity estimation using ANGSD

-   I wrote a short scripts called bamstats_review.R located in `myscripts` to evaluate the mapping success.

    -   I saw that roughly 66% of reads mapped in proper pairs
    
    -   I obtained a depth of coverage between 2â€“3 X which suggests that I need to use a probabilistic framework for analyzing the genotype data
